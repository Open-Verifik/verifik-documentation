### Services Offered

Zelf Name Service is a self-custodial (non-custodian) solution, for managing your private seed phrase meaning you are solely in control of and responsible for your private seed phrases, private recovery keys and/or ZelfHash, and accordingly you can authorize different functions by signing with your seed phrases. You expressly acknowledge and agree that as Zelf Name Service is a self-custodial seed phrase management solutions, you are solely responsible for your activity and any risk of loss at all times. Zelf Name Service allows you to:

* View digital asset price information made available by third party service provider(s);
* Generate protocol addresses and associated private keys that you may use to send and receive digital assets;
* Browse and access third party decentralized application(s) (“DApp(s)”) and third party decentralized exchanges (“DEX”) through the mobile application’s web browser;

**Zelf Name Service (ZNS).** Users can access ZNS a self-custodian (non-custodial) seed phrase manager solution to visualize and hold Digital Assets. You control the Digital Assets held in your ZNS in the form of the ZelfHash representing the recovery keys and ultimately the ownership of the digital asset. The recovery keys are NOT permanently stored on your device. At any time, WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS, you can decrypt your ZelfHash and visualize the digital assets hosted in ZNS.

Access real time data of transaction history, asset balance and tokens found on a given public address. Conduct transactions using digital assets within the supported networks. At any time, subject to having internet access and the congestion on the blockchain, you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending them to a different blockchain address.

**Recovery Key Management:** ZNS generates a 12 to 24-word recovery key, known as a ‘seed phrase', that you and only you have access to. This recovery key is then encrypted using the entropy obtained from a liveness detection of the end user. Zelf also allows you to import recovery keys, create and manage multiple accounts all encrypted with ZelfEncrypt. The result of the encryption is a ZelfHash in the form of a QR code, which replaces the need to memorize or safely stored the recovery keys. The ZelfHash must be scanned or uploaded to the ZNS app to get access to the digital assets contained in it.

**Ownership and Control.** When holding your digital assets in ZNS, Zelf does not maintain control over your account, ZelfHash or recovery keys. You own and control Digital Assets held in your account. As the owner of the Digital Assets in your ZNS, you shall bear all risk of losing such Digital Assets. Users are responsible for the risk of loss of their ZelfHash and/or recovery keys, and Zelf will not recover such keys. Please remember that Zelf will never have access to the ZelfHash or recovery key so we cannot move funds on your behalf, nor can we help you access digital assets in your ZNS should you lose the ZelfHash and/or recovery key.

### **Account Creation**

In order to use ZNS you must either import or create an account. When you create an account, you will be assigned a recovery key which we convert into a ZelfHash in the form of a QR code. YOU DO NOT NEED TO STORE THE RECOVERY KEY, INSTEAD WE RECOMMEND TO SAVE THE ZELFHASH IN YOUR PHONE OR IN ANY PLACE ACCESSIBLE FOR SCAN OR UPLOAD ON YOUR DEVICE. After scanning or uploading your ZelfHash code through the ZNS, you will be prompted to do a liveness authentication to be able to access your funds. The liveness detection will deter any Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or any type of video injection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that you shall assume all risks related to the use of the Services and you shall be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your ZelfHash code.

When you create an account, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your account. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) utilize the two layers of encryption presented in the app; (b) do not store the recovery key in plain text online or in an unsecured physical location, instead save the ZelfHash code in an accessible place.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with activities that occur on your account with or without your authorization.

#### **Push Notifications**

You may agree to receive push notifications from ZNS that will alert you when blockchain networks supported by ZNS are congested and when transactions involving your account have been completed. If you would like to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service by accessing “Settings” and enabling “Push Notifications”.

You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your account and/or “gas” to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions or losses you incur due to incorrectly set transaction fees (i.e. too low or too high) or due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your account address.
