# Vehicle Verification

Vehicle registration documents, also known as license plates or patents, are the primary means of legally identifying a vehicle. They provide information on ownership, history, technical specifications, legal reports, and the administrative status of the car or motorcycle.

With Verifik, your company can consult and validate vehicle registration documents in seconds using automated analysis, access to official sources (depending on the country), and anti-fraud technology designed for KYC processes, logistics, insurance, and mobility.

## What is a vehicle registration?

A vehicle registration number is a unique code assigned by the transit authority of each country.

Its function is to: i) Officially identify the vehicle, ii) Associate it with an owner or entity, iii) Record its legal and technical status, iv) Facilitate administrative and traffic controls.

Depending on the country, registration numbers may include:

Alphanumeric combinations
Regional codes
Special formats for taxis, public transport, diplomatic vehicles, rental cars, etc.
Temporary or official license plates
Colors differentiated by use or category
