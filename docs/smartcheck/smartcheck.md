### 2. Unified Interface for Easy Access

SmartCheck provides a unified interface that allows users to access all available APIs from a single screen. This makes it easy to search for specific services and filter results by country, category, or specific API endpoints.

### 3. Real-Time API Testing and Integration

SmartCheck enables real-time testing of API requests directly within the platform. This feature allows users to input the required parameters, such as document type and number, and immediately view the response in both a human-readable format and JSON. This ensures that users can seamlessly integrate the APIs into their systems and verify that the data returned meets their requirements.

### 4. Detailed Consultation Reports

After conducting a verification, SmartCheck generates a detailed consultation report. This report includes the parameters used, the API endpoint accessed, and the results returned. Users can view the results in a no-code format for easy interpretation, or as raw JSON data for further processing.

### 5. Flexible and Scalable

SmartCheck is designed to be flexible and scalable, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes. Whether you need to validate a single document or perform thousands of checks daily, SmartCheck can handle the load efficiently.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up an Account

To begin using SmartCheck, you need to create an account on the Verifik platform. Once your account is set up, you can access the SmartCheck dashboard, where you'll be able to configure your API requests and manage your verification processes.

### 2. Navigating the SmartCheck Dashboard

The SmartCheck dashboard is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly:

* **API Search and Filters:** Use the search bar to quickly find the API you need by typing in keywords. Filters by country and category allow you to narrow down the available services, ensuring that you can find the exact API required for your verification process.
* **API Endpoints:** Each API endpoint is listed with a brief description of its functionality, pricing per request, and supported countries. Clicking on an endpoint provides more detailed information and a sample code snippet for easy integration.

### 3. Making an API Request

To make an API request, follow these steps:

* **Select the API:** Choose the appropriate API from the dashboard. For example, if you need to verify a Colombian citizen's identity, select the "Colombian Citizen Information" API.
* **Input Parameters:** Enter the required parameters, such as document type and document number. The platform will guide you on the necessary inputs to ensure a successful request.
* **Test the API:** Use the built-in testing feature to send the request. SmartCheck will return the data in real-time, which you can review in both a formatted view and raw JSON. This step ensures that the API is functioning as expected before you integrate it into your system.

### 4. Reviewing the Consultation Report

Once an API request is completed, SmartCheck generates a consultation report. This report is available on the platform and can be viewed at any time:

* **Parameters Used:** The report details the parameters that were used in the request, such as document numbers and types.
