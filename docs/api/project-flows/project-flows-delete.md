## Example Request

<CodeExamples
url="/v3/project-flows/64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346"
method="DELETE"
params={{
    id: "64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346"
  }}
/>

## Response Format

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
    "data": {
        "_id": "64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346",
        "type": "onboarding",
        "target": "personal",
        "status": "deleted"
    }
}
```

## Soft Delete Behavior

In development environments, project flows are soft-deleted rather than permanently removed:

-   **Development**: Project flows are marked as deleted but remain in the database
-   **Production**: Project flows are permanently removed from the database

## Cascade Deletion

When a project flow is deleted, the following associated resources are also removed:

-   **Configuration Data**: All flow-specific configuration and settings
-   **Webhook References**: Any webhook associations
-   **Integration Settings**: API endpoints and test configurations
-   **Document Templates**: Associated document processing templates

:::warning Irreversible Action
Project flow deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All associated configuration data will be permanently removed from the system.

## Examples

### Delete Project Flow

<CodeExamples
url="/v3/project-flows/64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346"
method="DELETE"
params={{
    id: "64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346"
  }}
/>

### Delete Project Flow with Confirmation

First, check if project flow exists:

<CodeExamples
url="/v3/project-flows/64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346"
method="GET"
params={{
    id: "64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346"
  }}
/>

Then proceed with deletion:

<CodeExamples
url="/v3/project-flows/64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346"
method="DELETE"
params={{
    id: "64a1b2c3d4e5f6789012346"
  }}
/>

## Pre-deletion Checks

Before deleting a project flow, consider:

1. **Active Users**: Ensure no users are currently going through the verification process
2. **Project Dependencies**: Check if the parent project depends on this flow
3. **Data Backup**: Export any necessary configuration data before deletion
4. **Integration Dependencies**: Verify no external systems depend on this flow

## Impact on Parent Project

Deleting a project flow will:

-   Remove the flow from the parent project's `projectFlows` array
-   Update the project's `lastStep` if this was the active flow
-   Potentially affect the project's overall configuration status

## Rate Limits

-   **50 requests per minute** per user

:::tip Safe Deletion
Before deleting a project flow, consider setting its status to "paused" first to prevent new users from starting the process while you prepare for deletion.
:::

:::warning Data Retention
Ensure you have exported any necessary configuration data before deletion, as this action permanently removes all flow-specific settings.
:::

:::note Project Impact
Deleting a project flow may affect the parent project's functionality. Ensure the project has alternative flows or is ready for deletion as well.
