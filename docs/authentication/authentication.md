# Authentication

Verifik offers solutions via API's that are accessible with **a token using JWT.**

JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for representing claims securely between two parties.

> [JWT.IO ](https://jwt.io)allows you to decode & verify the token we provide to you.

Since we offer solutions of password less logins, our token generation uses the same technology we sell to you as our customer, for that reason we only generate tokens that are valid for certain time that can be obtained via email / phone **one-time passwords (OTPs).**

## Authentication Methods

### API KEY ACCESS VIA EMAIL
Request your token via Email OTP's.

### API KEY ACCESS VIA PHONE
Request your token via Phone OTP's.

### RENEW YOUR API ACCESS TOKEN
Renew your token before it expires.

### CREATE A NEW API ACCESS TOKEN & REVOKE PREVIOUS TOKENS
For security reasons, you should always renew and revoke tokens.
