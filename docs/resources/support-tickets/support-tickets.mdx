### Overview

Support tickets are essential for managing customer service inquiries and technical support. Verifik's Support Ticket system helps you track and resolve customer issues efficiently.

#### Key Components

* **Ticket Management** - Create and track support tickets
* **Thread System** - Maintain conversation history
* **Priority Levels** - Categorize tickets by urgency
* **Status Tracking** - Monitor ticket resolution progress
* **File Attachments** - Support document uploads
* **Assignment System** - Assign tickets to support agents

### How Support Tickets Work

Every Support Ticket represents a single customer service interaction that tracks user issues, questions, and requests. When someone submits a support request, Verifik creates a Support Ticket to manage the entire support process from initial submission to resolution.

1. **Ticket Creation** - Customers or staff create support tickets through the API
2. **Categorization** - Tickets are categorized by type and priority
3. **Assignment** - Tickets can be assigned to support agents
4. **Communication** - Messages are added as threads to the ticket
5. **Resolution** - Tickets move through statuses until resolved
6. **Closure** - Resolved tickets are closed with resolution notes

### What Support Tickets Track

#### Ticket Information
