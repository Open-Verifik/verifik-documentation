# Identity Verification in Mexico

Verifik's Identity Verification API helps you authenticate Mexican citizens using the Unique Population Registry Code (CURP). It's designed to streamline your KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, prevent fraud, and ensure you meet all regulatory requirements effortlessly.

We built this integration for businesses that need a fast, secure, and automated way to confirm the true identity of users, employees, or customers.

## What does this API validate?

Our API connects directly with official records to validate:

-   **Full Name & CURP**: Supports *Clave Única de Registro de Población* (CURP).
-   **Personal Details**: Returns date of birth, gender, and nationality.
-   **Identity Match**: Confirms that the name provided matches the CURP number.

By verifying these details, you can be confident that the person you're dealing with is real and holds a valid document, significantly lowering the risk of impersonation and fraud.
