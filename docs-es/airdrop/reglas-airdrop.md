### **II. Eligibility**

1. Only users who purchase ZelfNames between **February 1, 2025**, and **December 1, 2025**, will be eligible for the airdrop.
2. Users who reserved free ZelfNames before February 1, 2025, will **NOT** qualify for the airdrop.
3. A minimum of **15,000 domains** must be purchased during the airdrop period for the program to proceed.
4. The earlier a user purchases their ZelfName, the higher their priority in receiving tokens during the airdrop distribution.

### **III. Token Distribution Breakdown**

The **44M tokens** allocated for the airdrop will be distributed among eligible users based on their ZelfName purchase characteristics, with priority given to users who:

1. Purchased names with **1-5 characters**:
   * **Allocation**: 35% of the total airdrop = **13.2M tokens**
   * These short, premium ZelfNames are considered highly valuable, giving their owners a larger share of the tokens.
2. Purchased names with **6-15 characters**:
   * **Allocation**: 45% of the total airdrop = **26.4M tokens**
   * This group represents the majority of standard ZelfNames and receives the largest portion of the airdrop.
3. Purchased names with **16-27 characters**:
   * **Allocation**: 20% of the total airdrop = **8.8M tokens**
   * Longer ZelfNames, while less premium, still contribute significantly to the Zelf ecosystem.

### **IV. Token Allocation Rules**

1. The airdrop will prioritize users who purchased **multiple years upfront** (2, 3, 4 + years) and those who purchased **higher-priced domains (ZelfNames)**.
2. Token distribution within each group (1-5 characters, 6-15 characters, and 16-27 characters) will be proportional to:
   * The **total amount paid** by the user.
   * The **number of years** purchased in a single transaction.
3. Users who purchase multiple ZelfNames will receive an aggregate airdrop based on the combined value of their purchases across different names.

### **V. Final Airdrop Amount**

The final airdrop amount per user will depend on:

1. The **total number of eligible participants**.
2. The **total number of ZelfNames purchased**.
3. Each userâ€™s **purchase value ranking** relative to others in their group.

### **Terms and Conditions**

1. Users must provide a valid wallet address during their ZelfName purchase to receive their airdrop.
2. Any disputes regarding eligibility or token allocation must be submitted to Zelf support before **December 20, 2025**.
3. Zelf reserves the right to update these rules if necessary, with prior notice given to all participants.
4. All the **free domains** given away **do not participate in the airdrop**, unless they decide to pay for extra years  of registrations, then they can qualify for the airdrop.&#x20;
