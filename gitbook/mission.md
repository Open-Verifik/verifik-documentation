## Universal Self Sovereignty

Zelf is on a mission to bring cryptocurrency to 8 billion people, beginning with the Zelf Name Service, the world’s first wallet to feature ZK Face Proof®—a privacy-preserving, liveness-enabled technology designed to empower individuals with true self-sovereignty.

Inspired by the vision articulated in Balaji Srinivasan's work, Zelf provides universal access, enabling people from all backgrounds to participate in and give rise to [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/).

> When we think of a nation state, we immediately think of the lands, but when we think of a network state, we should instantly think of the minds. That is, if the nation state system starts with the map of the globe and assigns each patch of land to a single state, the network state system starts with the 8+ billion humans of the world and attracts each mind to one or more networks.&#x20;

Most crypto projects limit themselves to speak in terms of mass adoption, this is due to been hindered by the friction inherent in legacy infrastructures. Centralized exchanges require compliance with KYC/AML regulations, while decentralized architectures like DEXs and self-custodial wallets place the burden of securing recovery seed phrases entirely on the user.

Zelf is the first project to resolve this dilemma, delivering true self-custody without compromising accessibility. Our wallet architecture securely stores recovery seed phrases using ZK Face Proof®, while encrypting them with advanced facial recognition technology. This groundbreaking approach allows us to move beyond the limits of mass adoption and confidently aim for **Universal Adoption**.
