These Terms and Conditions apply to the entire Platform and constitute the terms of use and privacy for all services currently provided and those added in the future by VERIFIK LLC (hereinafter, "VERIFIK"). The services that VERIFIK makes available to the User through the Platform are subject to these Terms and Conditions. A User who does not agree with the Terms and Conditions will not be able to use the Platform's Services. This Agreement does not create any partnership, mandate, franchise, or employment relationship between VERIFIK and the User. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the User will be the natural person who registers to use the Platform's Services.

**User Capacity** The User who accepts these Terms and Conditions must be legally capable of entering into a contract as permitted by their autonomy of will and the laws applicable to them. VERIFIK understands that the User who accepts these Terms and Conditions is aware of whether or not they are capable of entering into contracts. Those considered absolutely or relatively or partially incapable must have authorization from their legal representatives to enter into this Agreement, and the latter will be considered responsible for any conduct of their proxies. The User who wishes to use the Platform must meet the age of majority required according to the applicable law of their country of residence and the country, state, or city in which they are located when using the Platform (hereinafter "Applicable Law"). If residing in a jurisdiction that restricts the use of the Platform due to age or restricts the ability to enter into contracts such as this Agreement due to age, the User must respect these age limits and refrain from using the Platform.

### **License**

VERIFIK grants a revocable, non-exclusive, temporary, non-transferable, and limited license to download, install, and use the Platform under the terms of this Agreement; therefore, under no circumstances does the User acquire ownership of the Platform.

### **Registration**

To use the Services, the User must open an account (hereinafter, "Account") on the Platform and provide the requested information in the forms enabled to register the Account. At the time of registration, the Platform will ask the User to enter the email address they wish to use to access it, as well as their name and phone number. Once the data is entered, VERIFIK will send the User an email and a text/WhatsApp message to confirm the Account. After confirming the validation code, the Account will be activated, and the User can begin to enjoy the Services available on the Platform. The Account corresponds to the credentials the User has to access the Platform, and only one Account will be enabled for each User. Users can access the Services when they have an active Account. The User can access the Account from any tablet, cell phone, computer, or any other device with an Android or iOS operating system that allows an internet connection. VERIFIK understands that any information provided by the User is done so under oath and, therefore, exempts VERIFIK from possessing false information about any User. In any case, VERIFIK reserves the right to contact the User at any time to verify their information or any other data they have provided to VERIFIK by any means. The User is fully responsible for all activity that occurs in the Account, including any actions taken by people to whom the User has granted access to the Account. VERIFIK reserves the right to suspend or block the current or future use of the Platform and/or delete the Account if it suspects that the User has provided false, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete information (or that has become false, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete). In any case, VERIFIK reserves the right to suspend, block, or delete an active Account without being obligated to communicate or explain the reasons for its decision and without this generating any right to compensation or indemnification in favor of the User.

### **Account Security**

It is the User's responsibility to ensure that their registration email and Account password, as well as other information for accessing the Platform, are kept in a secure place and not disclosed to third parties. Additionally, the User agrees to keep their Account information secure so that the Service remains inaccessible to third parties or unauthorized persons. If the User shares or misuses this access information to the Service, the User releases VERIFIK from any responsibility that may arise from this situation. Likewise, VERIFIK will not be responsible for the loss of information due to force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, or actions of a third party.

### **Services**

VERIFIK is a company focused on providing services to businesses (B2B) or individuals (B2C) through its Platform. The Platform consists of cloud software that allows Users to verify personal data and other public information by querying information from public and private sources. VERIFIK offers its Services through different subscription plans ("Plans") obtained through the Platform as indicated in the "Plans" section of these Terms and Conditions. VERIFIK provides the following Services for Users to acquire through the Plans:

* **Queries**: Consists of querying and verifying the User's identification document or vehicle plate in public, national, and international databases. This service is purely informative.
* **Reports**: Consists of querying and verifying the User's identification document or vehicle plate in public, national, and international databases. With this Service, the User can download a PDF report specifying the query date and the origin of the sources of the query.

Each of the Services described in this section will be measured in volume of queries or report generation (hereinafter, "Transactions"). Therefore, one (1) Transaction means the use of one (1) operation corresponding to the Services. Each operation of the Service will be counted as an independent transaction. VERIFIK reserves the right to modify, change, add, or remove the Services offered at any time. Changes to the Services will be communicated by the means and at the times that VERIFIK deems appropriate.

### **Plans**

VERIFIK provides Users with different service plans (hereinafter, "Plan"), which will allow the consumption of credits (hereinafter "Credits") within a monthly or annual Plan. The Credits will have variable costs depending on the product they constitute. The cost derived from the use of the Platform will depend on the type of Plan chosen by the User. The Services expressly mentioned in each Plan will be understood to be included in the value of the Plan. In the event that the User consumes all the Credits of their Plan, the price of additional Transactions will be subject to the conditions of the acquired Plan. The Plans will be valid for the time established in the specifications of each Plan. The User acknowledges that unused Credits will expire upon the expiration of their Plan. The Plans will automatically renew on the anniversary month. VERIFIK reserves the right to modify, change, add, or remove the value of the Plans offered at any time. Changes to the Plans will be communicated by the means and at the times that VERIFIK deems appropriate. VERIFIK commits to ensuring that such changes do not affect the current validity or period. The User must select the type of Plan they wish to acquire and that best suits the Services they seek to obtain. In any case, VERIFIK will not be responsible for errors made by the User when choosing their Plan.

### **Payment for Plans**

The User will pay for the chosen Plan through the Google Pay or Apple Pay platform, as appropriate. At the time of payment, the User accepts the terms and conditions of these platforms, as well as their privacy policies.

The User acknowledges and agrees that their Plan subscription will be automatically renewed under the same acquired period. Therefore, the User agrees that Google Pay and Apple Pay will automatically debit the registered payment methods for the Plan payment.

The User acknowledges, agrees, and authorizes VERIFIK to charge all amounts owed by the User (including any subsequent taxes or fees, as applicable) corresponding to or associated with their Account.

Each User is responsible for maintaining available funds for the Plan charge so that payments can be processed through the Platform. Payments made are non-refundable except as provided by Applicable Law or the terms and conditions of Google Pay or Apple Pay.

The User affirms under penalty of perjury that their income is not related to illicit activities, including activities and operations related to money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption, transnational bribery, or any other illicit conduct established in Applicable Law. In any case, VERIFIK may, at any time, require the User to provide documentation so that VERIFIK can comply with the relevant policies and measures related to: (i) AML/CTF, (ii) Know Your Customer ("KYC"), (iii) Due Diligence, and (iv) Personal Data Protection.

### **Cancellation Policy**

In the event of termination of the Services by the User, they will be subject to the cancellation, refund, and return policies of Google Play and Apple Pay. If there are any withholdings or costs related to the refund transaction, these must be borne by the User.

### **Access to the Platform**

To use the Platform, the User must have a data network connection. Each User is responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware and software or devices necessary to access and use the Platform and any updates to it.

VERIFIK is not responsible for damages that may occur due to improper use of the Platform and will not be responsible for any losses, damages, or harm of any kind arising from mere access or use of the Platform.

### **Scope and Level of Service**

Under normal conditions, the Platform has a downtime of approximately 10%, meaning the Platform is available 90% of the time. VERIFIK will take actions it deems appropriate to ensure the Platform is available to the User but cannot guarantee its availability due to events (communication failures, acts of third parties, maintenance, Platform restructuring, among others) beyond VERIFIK's control and responsibility.

However, VERIFIK guarantees that the Platform will be accessible from any tablet, cell phone, computer, or any other device with an Android or iOS operating system that allows an internet connection, provided the User remembers their Account credentials and the internet connection service conditions from each internet provider allow it. If access is not possible due to the type of connection and its characteristics, communication failures, or poor service from the mentioned provider, this does not imply at any time a breach of the contracted Service by VERIFIK.

### **Restrictions and Limitations**

The right to use the Platform granted is non-transferable, revocable, non-exclusive, and limited for use by the User under the Terms and Conditions and not for exploitation or commercialization by the User. It is prohibited for the User to perform or allow a third party to:

The User acknowledges and declares that, in case the Services are used to consult information about a third party, the User will act as the Controller of the personal data and VERIFIK will act as the Processor of the information, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy. In this case, the User will collect, store, use, circulate, and delete the personal data in compliance with Applicable Law.

VERIFIK does not assume and will not have any obligation or liability to the User or any other person or entity for the Third-Party Services.

The Third-Party Services and links to them are provided solely for the User's convenience, and the User accesses and uses them entirely at their own risk, subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties.

### **Limitation of Liability**

The User acknowledges that VERIFIK's Services are purely informational, based on information provided by public databases. In this regard, the User acknowledges that it is their sole responsibility to verify the information available on the Platform and releases VERIFIK from any liability for decisions made by the User based on the information provided under the Services.

In no event will VERIFIK or its providers be liable for direct or indirect damages, or for tangible or intangible losses arising in connection with these Terms and Conditions (including, but not limited to, damages for lost profits, loss of data, business interruption, personal injury, loss of privacy arising from the use or inability to use the platform, third-party software, and/or third-party hardware used with the Platform, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if VERIFIK or any provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

VERIFIK will be liable solely and exclusively to third parties and the User in cases where gross negligence or willful misconduct by VERIFIK is demonstrated as the cause of the damage or event for which it must be held liable.

The User expressly waives the right to present any claim, demand, or legal and/or administrative action against VERIFIK, its administrators, representatives, employees, and shareholders, as they understand and accept that VERIFIK's role is limited to providing information found in various publicly accessible databases. Consequently, VERIFIK will not be responsible for any damage or harm that the User or any third party may suffer due to or in connection with the use of the Services through the Platform.

### **Platform Modifications**

VERIFIK reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Platform or any Service connected to it, with or without prior notice and without liability to the User or any other third party.

### **Platform Updates**

VERIFIK may periodically make improvements to the features and/or functionalities of the Platform, which may include patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades, and other modifications (hereinafter referred to as "Updates").

Updates may modify or remove certain features and/or functionalities of the Platform. The User agrees that VERIFIK has no obligation to (i) provide Updates or (ii) continue providing or enabling particular features and/or functionalities of the Platform. Furthermore, the User agrees that all Updates (i) will be considered an integral part of the Platform and (ii) will be subject to these Terms and Conditions.

### **Updates to the Terms and Conditions**

VERIFIK reserves the right to modify and revise these Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice. When a modification is implemented, VERIFIK will publish the updated Terms and Conditions ("Updated Version") on the Platform for Users to read the corresponding changes. The Updated Version will take effect upon publication and will not apply retroactively. Users have the option to expressly accept the Updated Version. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the continuous use of the Platform and its Services by the User after the publication of an Updated Version will constitute tacit acceptance of such Updated Version by the User. If the User does not agree with the Updated Version, they may not continue using the Platform.

### **Entire Agreement**

These Terms and Conditions, which include and incorporate VERIFIK's Privacy Policy, constitute the complete agreement between the User and VERIFIK regarding the use of the Platform and replace all previous agreements, written or oral, between the User and VERIFIK regarding the terms of use and service of the Platform, and cannot be changed or modified by the User.

The User may be subject to additional terms and conditions that apply when using or purchasing other services from VERIFIK, which will be provided at the time of such use or purchase.

### **Arbitration Clause**

Any differences arising in relation to the subject matter of the Terms and Conditions and the Services provided by VERIFIK, their execution, interpretation, validity, obligations of the parties, value, settlement, or termination, as well as any claim, controversy, or dispute between the User and VERIFIK, their processors, suppliers, or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors, or employees), whether arising before or after the term of these Terms and Conditions, will be submitted to this section.

For all matters related to the interpretation, compliance, and execution of this Agreement, the Parties expressly submit to the laws, jurisdiction, and competence of the Local or Federal Courts of the State of Wyoming, United States, which will be competent to hear any lawsuit or claim arising from this instrument, waiving any other jurisdiction that may correspond to them due to their current or future domiciles.

The Parties establish the arbitral process as the means of resolving disputes, which will be regulated and conducted under the rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”), with the understanding that the laws of Wyoming will govern the processes in which the ICC rules are unclear.

Before initiating arbitration, the User and VERIFIK agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by granting each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve the dispute informally and directly. Both parties acknowledge that this is a fundamental and indispensable requirement to proceed with arbitration, and any breach of this requirement will constitute a material breach of the Terms and Conditions.

### **Additional Provisions**

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision or part of these Terms and Conditions is unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms and Conditions will continue in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms and Conditions will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of VERIFIK.

The Service is not intended to be distributed or used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to Applicable Law. Therefore, individuals who choose to access the Platform from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for complying with local laws, to the extent that local laws are applicable.

The section titles used in this Agreement are for convenience only and will have no legal significance.
