### Creating Effective Support Tickets

<figure><img src="https://3837106321-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FhfLoKpmSMVbW1nu6SbSu%2Fuploads%2FpxRxJ7uD6HQXc1inKqsr%2FScreenshot%202025-08-01%20at%201.59.07%E2%80%AFPM.png?alt=media&#x26;token=15287ffa-05c0-4338-8554-5dc1f46f27e2" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The most important factor in getting quick, accurate help is providing the right information from the start. Here's how to structure your request for maximum impact.

#### Writing a Clear Title

Your title is the first thing our support team sees. Make it count:

* **Be specific**: "API returning 404 errors" vs "API not working"
* **Include the service**: "SmartCheck Colombia API" vs "API issue"
* **Mention the outcome**: "Cannot authenticate users" vs "Having problems"

#### Choosing the Right Category

Categories route your ticket to specialists who understand your specific type of issue. The category you choose determines what additional information the system will ask for.

#### Getting the Right Help by Category

**Billing and Payment Issues**

When you select billing, you'll be connected with our finance team. They need transaction details to help you quickly:

* **Reference numbers**: Invoice IDs, transaction codes, or payment confirmations
* **Timeline context**: When the charge occurred and what triggered it
* **Expected vs actual**: What you intended to purchase vs what was charged

**Integration and Development Support**

Our technical team helps with implementation challenges. The more technical context you provide, the faster they can diagnose:

* **Code context**: What you're building and how you're implementing it
* **Error specifics**: Exact error messages, status codes, and when they occur
* **Environment details**: Development, staging, or production settings

**API-Specific Issues (SmartCheck)**

For API problems, you'll be asked to specify which API you're working with. This routes your ticket to specialists familiar with that specific data source:

* **Request/response data**: What you're sending and what you're receiving back
* **Endpoint behavior**: Expected vs actual API responses
* **Integration pattern**: How you're calling the API and handling responses

**Document Processing (SmartScan)**

Document scanning issues require visual context. Our scanning specialists can help most effectively when they can see:

* **Sample documents**: Examples of what you're trying to process
* **Quality issues**: Scanning problems, clarity issues, or formatting errors
* **Processing expectations**: What data you need extracted vs what you're getting

**User Authentication (SmartAccess)**

Authentication problems often involve multiple moving parts. Help us understand your complete setup:

* **Flow description**: How users are supposed to authenticate
* **Failure points**: Where in the process things break down
* **User experience**: What users see vs what they should see

**Product Configuration (SmartEnroll)**

Setup and configuration issues benefit from understanding your intended workflow:

* **Business requirements**: What you're trying to accomplish
* **Current progress**: How far you've gotten in the setup process
* **Blocking issues**: What's preventing you from moving forward

#### Writing Your Message

The message is where you tell the story of your issue. Think of it as explaining the problem to a colleague who wants to help but wasn't there when it happened.

**Structure your message like this**:

1. **What you were trying to do** - Your goal or intended outcome
2. **What you expected to happen** - The normal, working behavior
3. **What actually happened** - The problem or error you encountered
4. **What you've tried** - Steps you've already taken to resolve it

**Make it actionable**:

* Include specific error messages (copy and paste, don't paraphrase)
* Provide step-by-step reproduction instructions
* Mention environmental factors (browser, device, network, etc.)
* Reference any documentation you were following

#### Including Supporting Files

Visual evidence often communicates problems more clearly than words alone. Attach files that help tell your story:

<figure><img src="https://3837106321-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FhfLoKpmSMVbW1nu6SbSu%2Fuploads%2FmcWVvQxEWhXR1fJCKDQj%2FScreenshot%202025-08-01%20at%201.59.07%E2%80%AFPM.png?alt=media&#x26;token=90488581-3de2-4927-b77a-b3e685327a36" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Screenshots and Images**:

* Error messages and unexpected behaviors
* Configuration screens and settings
* Before/after comparisons
* User interface issues

**Technical Files**:

* Log files (with sensitive data removed)
* Configuration exports
* Sample data that reproduces the issue
* API response examples

**Documentation**:

* Links to relevant Verifik documentation
* Your internal documentation or requirements
* Third-party integration guides you're following

### Managing Your Support Requests

#### Tracking Progress

Your support dashboard gives you a clear view of where each request stands. Tickets move through different stages as our team works on them:

**Active Tickets**: Issues currently being investigated or waiting for your input **Resolved Tickets**: Problems that have been solved and are waiting for your confirmation **Closed Tickets**: Completed requests that have been resolved to your satisfaction

#### Staying in the Loop

When you click into a specific ticket, you'll see the complete conversation history. This is where you can:

* **Follow the progress**: See what our team has discovered and what they're working on
* **Provide additional information**: Answer questions or clarify details
* **Test solutions**: Try suggested fixes and report back on the results
* **Escalate if needed**: Let us know if the proposed solution doesn't work

<figure><img src="https://3837106321-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FhfLoKpmSMVbW1nu6SbSu%2Fuploads%2F35ekhbS4V9wLJGmjlZjA%2FScreenshot%202025-08-01%20at%202.17.42%E2%80%AFPM.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4beabead-acef-4825-96bc-cf4223275517" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Getting the Best Results

#### The Art of the Good Ticket

Think of creating a support ticket like telling a detective story. You want to give our team enough clues to solve the mystery quickly:

**Set the Scene**: What were you working on when this happened? What's your bigger goal? **Describe the Crime**: What went wrong? When did you first notice it? **Provide Evidence**: Screenshots, error messages, logs - anything that shows the problem **Share Your Investigation**: What have you already tried? What ruled out certain causes?

#### Building a Productive Dialogue

Great support conversations are collaborative. Here's how to make them work:

**When we ask for more information**: We're not stalling - we genuinely need those details to help you effectively **When we suggest a solution**: Try it and let us know exactly what happens, even if it doesn't work **When something changes**: Keep us updated if the problem evolves or if you discover new information

### What Our Support Team Needs to Know

#### Technical Context

Your technical environment affects how our solutions work in your specific setup:

* **Development stage**: Are you building, testing, or in production?
* **Integration approach**: How are you connecting to our services?
* **Scale and volume**: How much traffic or how many users are involved?
* **Recent changes**: Did anything change in your setup before the issue started?

#### Business Impact

Understanding your priorities helps us respond appropriately:

* **Urgency level**: Is this blocking your launch, affecting live users, or a nice-to-have improvement?
* **User impact**: How many people are affected and how severely?
* **Timeline pressures**: Do you have deadlines we should know about?
* **Workaround status**: Are you completely blocked or do you have a temporary solution?

#### Environmental Details

The technical details that help us reproduce and solve problems:

* **Consistent errors**: Do you see the same issue every time or is it intermittent?
* **Error patterns**: Does it happen with specific data, users, or times of day?
* **System specifications**: What browser, device, or server setup are you using?
* **Network factors**: Are you behind a firewall, using a VPN, or in a specific geographic region?

### Troubleshooting Common Situations

#### When Things Don't Work as Expected

Before creating a ticket, these quick checks often resolve issues:

* **Documentation review**: Double-check our API docs or setup guides
* **Environment verification**: Confirm you're using the right endpoints and credentials
