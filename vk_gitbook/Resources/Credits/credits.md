# Credits

Credits serve as the universal currency for accessing and consuming our suite of services, including SmartCheck, SmartAccess, SmartEnroll, and more. Credits simplify billing and usage tracking by consolidating all interactions—whether via API or no-code solutions—into a single, manageable account. This system is designed to provide flexibility and scalability for clients, allowing both their staff and integrated systems to seamlessly utilize Verifik’s offerings.Credits are primarily managed through a MongoDB-based schema in our backend, ensuring robust tracking, categorization, and expiration handling. This documentation outlines the purpose of credits and provides an overview of the underlying Credit model.Why We Use CreditsCredits are the backbone of Verifik’s service consumption model. Here’s why:

* **Unified Access:** Credits allow clients to access all Verifik services—such as SmartCheck (verification), SmartAccess (secure entry), and SmartEnroll (enrollment automation)—under one account. This eliminates the need for separate billing or tracking mechanisms per service.
* **Team Collaboration:** Clients can assign staff to their account, and all team members can utilize credits for their respective tasks, whether through API calls or pre-built no-code solutions.
* **API-Driven Flexibility:** Most interactions with Verifik occur via our APIs, and credits are deducted based on usage (e.g., API requests). This ensures a pay-as-you-go model that scales with your needs.
* **No-Code Simplicity:** For clients who prefer plug-and-play solutions, our no-code tools integrate seamlessly with the same credit system, allowing non-technical users to leverage Verifik’s features without custom development.
* **Transparency and Control:** Credits provide a clear way to monitor usage, manage budgets, and track service consumption over time.

In short, credits streamline the experience, making it easy to consume Verifik’s powerful tools while maintaining a single point of accountability.
