# Biometric Validations

Biometric Validations are the core verification system within Verifik that processes and validates user biometric data during the authentication and registration process. Think of them as the security checkpoint that ensures users are who they claim to be by verifying their unique physical characteristics through advanced facial recognition and liveness detection technology.

### **How Biometric Validations Work**

Every Biometric Validation represents a single biometric verification session that processes user-submitted facial images or biometric data. When someone needs to verify their identity during signup, login, or account verification, Verifik creates a Biometric Validation to capture facial images, perform liveness detection, and confirm the user's identity through advanced biometric analysis.

Currently, Biometric Validations support these types:

* **validation** - Standard biometric verification process
* **login** - Biometric verification for user authentication
* **onboarding** - Biometric verification for new user registration

**Integration Options:**

* **Redirect URLs**: Where users go after verification
* **Webhook URLs**: External notification endpoints
* **Custom Parameters**: Additional data for your systems
* **Status Tracking**: Real-time verification progress

### **Getting Started**

1. **Set up your biometric verification settings** (liveness detection preferences, collection integration)
2. **Configure your security requirements** (session expiration, retry limits, 2FA)
3. **Define your verification methods** (facial recognition, liveness detection)
4. **Set up your integration points** (redirects, webhooks, notifications)
5. **Test your configuration** before going live

### **What Happens When You Create a Biometric Validation**

1. **Verification Created**: Verifik creates a biometric verification with a unique ID
2. **Liveness Session**: A secure liveness detection session is initiated
3. **Image Capture**: User captures facial images for verification
4. **Biometric Analysis**: Advanced algorithms analyze facial features and liveness
5. **Status Updated**: Final status is recorded (validated, failed, or expired)

### **Monitoring and Management**

* **Status Tracking**: Monitor if your biometric validations are new, sent, validated, or failed
* **Liveness Confirmation**: Track successful liveness detection and facial recognition
* **Success Rates**: Monitor verification completion rates
* **Security Monitoring**: Track suspicious activity or failed verifications

### **Use Cases**

* **User Registration**: Verify identity during account creation
* **Password Reset**: Secure biometric verification for account recovery
* **Login Verification**: Additional security for user authentication
* **Account Updates**: Verify identity changes for existing accounts
* **Onboarding Flows**: Biometric verification as part of KYC processes
* **High-Security Access**: Multi-factor authentication with biometrics

### **Advanced Features**

**Liveness Detection**: Advanced anti-spoofing technology that ensures the person being verified is physically present and not using a photo, video, or mask.

**Collection Integration**: Seamless integration with identity databases for comprehensive verification and matching.

**Session Management**: Secure session handling for multi-step verification processes.

**Real-time Processing**: Instant verification results with immediate status updates.

Biometric Validations give you complete control over how user identities are verified in your system, ensuring the highest security standards while providing users with convenient and secure verification options through advanced facial recognition technology.
