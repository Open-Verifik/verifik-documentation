# Projects

Projects are the foundation of your Verifik system - they contain all the essential information about your company or organization that will be used across all your verification services. Think of them as your company profile that ensures your brand is represented correctly and legally when using Verifik's services.

### **How Projects Work**

Every Project serves as a container for your company's identity, branding, and legal information. When users go through verification processes, Verifik uses your Project settings to display your brand, send communications, and ensure compliance with legal requirements.
