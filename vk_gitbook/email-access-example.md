### Configuration

If you haven't created a project and a projectFlow with the property type = **login,** then here there are the links for that.

{% content-ref url="../../resources/projects/create-a-project" %}
[create-a-project](https://docs.verifik.co/resources/projects/create-a-project)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../resources/project-flows/create-a-project-flow" %}
[create-a-project-flow](https://docs.verifik.co/resources/project-flows/create-a-project-flow)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Let's get started

The flow mainly starts with the creation of the email validation then we proceed with the validation of that email validation that has a condition of time and also entering the one-time password that belongs to that email validation.
